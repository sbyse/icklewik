Model
=====

1. Add readonly versions of WikiModel and WikiEntry. Only readonly versions should be emitted / surfaced from the repositories
2. Alter WikiRepository and MasterRepository so that all "Add/Update/Delete" methods are protected or private and only called by a registered IWikiModelEventSource (like the slave repository already is)
	- Alternatively just have the MasterRepository, encapsulate its event loop and provide thread-safe async getter methods
3. Investigate issue with (slightly) slow subscription handlers on the EventLoopScheduler, for example make ModelSyncScheduler and NotificationScheduler point to the same reference and replace the call to ChangeNotifier with a Sleep(100) and you will see events being handled out of sync which isn't what I was expecting.
