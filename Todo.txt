Model
=====

1. Add readonly versions of WikiModel and WikiEntry. Only readonly versions should be emitted / surfaced from the repositories
2. Alter WikiRepository and MasterRepository so that all "Add/Update/Delete" methods are protected or private and only called by a registered IWikiModelEventSource (like the slave repository already is)
	- Alternatively just have the MasterRepository, encapsulate its event loop and provide thread-safe async getter methods
